# About
 an algorithm in Python language for a 2-wheel differential robot that used a camera module and ultrasonic sensors to autonomously navigate in a working environment.
the 2- wheel differential robot is a product designed for the healthcare industry to aid doctors in thier work inside the medical clinic.OpenCV library was used for image processing, object detection and object matching
Project was part of the mechatronics systems design course (MCT 382) at Ain Shams University, Mechatronics Department

# Simulation Video
Here is a part of the product's commercial video that illustrates an simulation for the algorithm on CoppeliaSim software.
